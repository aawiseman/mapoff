description: |
  Karangetang is one of level 3 (level 4 is eruption) volcano in Indonesia. For eruption preparedness and mitigation it is important to map the surrounding area by capturing building, settlement and road network data.<br><br>
  If the Karangetang gets completed, we would like to map another volcano in Indonesia. Mount Kelud is listed as one of the most dangerous volcanos in Indonesia. The eruption cycle is relatively short (9-25 years).The last eruption happened on February 13th, 2014. It trapped people in several villages and disrupted flights in Java island and The National Disaster Agency evacuated people within a 20km radius.
