Karangetang is one of level 3 (level 4 is eruption) volcanos in Indonesia. The island is inhabited by 22,000 people. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia having erupted forty-one times since 1675. For eruption preparedness and mitigation it is important to map the surrounding areas by capturing building, settlement and road network data.
